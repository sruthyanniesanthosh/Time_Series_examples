# Time_Series_examples
Time Series R codes

In this mini-project, I experimented with various Time Series concepts in R. Some of the concepts implemented are about 
Time Series Trends, Seasonal Effects, 
Parametric Models for Trends and Season: Regression; Holt-Winters,  
Random Vectors, Gaussian Distribution, Stationary Processes, 
Basis statistic, 
The ACF, Tests for Gaussianity, AR processes,
Linear Prediction of AR, PACF, MA processes, 
ARMA processes, parameter estimation,
Non-stationary processes: ARIMA 6 4,
GARCH processes,
Long-Memory Processes; Compositional + Count Time Series
and Multivariate time series
